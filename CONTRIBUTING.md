<h4>Reporting Bugs</h4>
	
The best way to help address bugs is by logging it using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues">GitHub Issues</a>. To do this, navigate to the repository that you believe the issue lies and create an issue using the following the <a href="https://github.com/salomonelli/best-resume-ever/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md">template</a>. Please include a clear but descriptive title and as many details as possible (screenshots are also welcome). It’s helpful to know what steps led up to the issue, how the behavior may have differed than was expected, what your current environment is and when the issue first appeared. The more detailed your information is, the easier it may be to solve. 

<h4>Creating and Updating Templates</h4>

Please read the <a href="https://github.com/salomonelli/best-resume-ever/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md">developer docs</a> on how to create or update templates. If you make any kind of changes to an existing template, please commit them as a new template.
